About
Despite already being in the Guinness Book of World Records as the tallest living invertebrate, I still dream of being a rubber snake when I grow up.  Elected to the Supreme Court at the age of five and fired that same year for graft and lewd behavior, I soon became a whisp of air buffeted by the breezes of reason.  Recently spent a year dead for tax reasons.
Experience
Sal's Pizza, Brooklyn, NY - engineer of the Literally Endless Pepperoni Roll; fired after pepperoni paradigm paradox swallowed entire shop, including Sal's favorite poodle, Quiche.  US Navy, Bethesda, MD - Whittled scrimshaw with eccentric yet approachable designs as a civilian employee; resigned due to unfounded rumors of whalebone theft and scrimshaw "not being part of my job", whatever that means.
